# Pencil Creator

![Pencil Creator](design/img/intro.png)

**Look & Feel + Animation First Design** — A Claude Code project for designing and validating look & feel and animations before building web applications.
It provides 11+ (and growing) animatable controls out of the box, and with this design harness you can discover and add controls like the above using only prompts.

# MS Blend for Visual Studio

![Pencil Creator](design/img/blend-xaml.png)

Pencil can implement animated web content using definition files alone.

Optionally, by using the **Blend tool** in addition,
you can control the detailed movements of animations more directly.
It serves as a **complement to Pencil's timeline & storyboard features**.

## Design-First Concept

The core philosophy of this project is **"Design before code, animation design before static design."**

+----------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Why design animations first?**

- Animations feel awkward when added later. You need to design **state transitions (Before -> After)** from the start for a natural UX.
- WPF Storyboard patterns are the best reference for explicitly defining animation properties (target, duration, easing).
- **Separating** static design from dynamic definitions allows animations to remain independent when the look & feel changes.

## WPF Animation Research Techniques

### Research -> Visualization Pipeline

WPF Storyboard/DoubleAnimation/Transform patterns are researched and **statically visualized** as Pencil design cards.

```
WebSearch XAML examples
    |
    v
Extract key properties
  - TargetProperty (Opacity, ScaleX, TranslateX...)
  - Duration, BeginTime
  - EasingFunction (CubicEaseOut, ElasticEase, BounceEase...)
  - RepeatBehavior, AutoReverse
    |
    v
Create Pencil card
  +------------------------------+
  | 1-1  FLOATING LABEL TEXTBOX  |  <- Number + Title
  |                               |
  | Focus -> Label Y^18px        |  <- Behavior description
  | Scale 75%, Color transition   |
  |                               |
  | +----------+  ->  +----------+|  <- Before -> After
  | | Username |      | Username ||
  | |          |      | #        ||
  | +----------+      +----------+|
  |                               |
  | <DoubleAnimation              |  <- XAML code

## 3-Case Harness Workflow

### Case A: WPF Template Enrichment

```bash
> "Research WPF templates and enrich them"
> "Research WPF Elastic/Spring effects and add them to wpf-animation.pen"
```

Directly researches WPF XAML via WebSearch and adds cards to `design/wpf-animation.pen`.

| Evaluation Axis | Max Score | Key Criteria |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| A1 Research Novelty | 35 | Were new techniques added without duplicating existing ones? |
| A2 Visualization Expressiveness | 35 | Is the Before->After transition intuitive? |
| A3 Metadata Completeness | 30 | Are the XAML code and sources accurate? |

### Case B: Project Design (Design-First)

```bash
> "Design a publisher app in Pencil referencing wpf-animation effects"
> "Design a shopping mall admin page referencing wpf-animation"
```

Uses wpf-animation.pen as a **reference library** to create separated static look & feel + animation guide designs.

| Evaluation Axis | Max Score | Key Criteria |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| B1 Requirements Fidelity | 35 | Were all required pages/features designed? |
| B2 Animation Guide Richness | 35 | Diverse WPF technique mapping + target specification |
| B3 Design Quality & Separation | 30 | Look & feel consistency + static/dynamic separation |

### Case W: HTML Implementation

```bash
> "Create HTML referencing the Pencil design"
> "Implement the publisher-app.pen design as a web page"
```

Converts the .pen file's static design + animation guide into HTML/CSS/JS.

| Evaluation Axis | Max Score | Key Criteria |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| W1 Design Coverage | 35 | How much of the .pen elements were reflected? |
| W2 Animation Fidelity | 35 | Were the animation guides actually implemented? |
| W3 Creative Extension | 30 | Were interactions beyond the design added? |

### Pipeline Bonus

| Path | Condition | XP Bonus |
|------|-----------|----------|
| A -> B | Both 60+ pts | x1.2 |
| A -> W | Both 60+ pts | x1.2 |
| B -> W | Both 60+ pts | x1.3 |
| A -> B -> W | All 60+ pts | x1.5 |

## RPG System

Earn XP upon task completion and level up.

```
Earned XP = Base XP (score x 10) x Grade multiplier (A:x5 B:x3 C:x1 D:x0.5) x Type multiplier (x1.2)

Grades: A (80-100) B (60-79) C (40-59) D (0-39)

Current Status: Lv.20 "Keyboard Warrior" | Total XP: 12,708

## WPF App Migration (for Blend Editing)

A project that converts 27 collected XAML animations into a WPF App editable via **Blend for Visual Studio** timeline.
When implementing animations on other platforms (web, mobile), use the Blend timeline to visually inspect keyframes and easing.

### Usage

```bash
# Open in Blend
design-wpf-app/design-wpf-app.slnx   # <- Open this file in Blend for Visual Studio

# Runtime execution (Gallery Viewer)
cd design-wpf-app && dotnet run

# Request new XAML migration (Claude Code)
> "Migrate XAML to WPF app"
> "Convert design/xaml/sample/28-xxx.xaml to Blend-compatible format"
```

### Blend Timeline Usage

1. Open `migrated/Sample{NN}_*.xaml` files in Blend
2. Select a Storyboard from the **timeline dropdown** (GlassHoverIn, SpinnerRotate, etc.)
3. Select **DemoSequence** to play the full animation flow at once
4. Click keyframes to modify easing, timing, and values

### Project Structure

```
design-wpf-app/
├── design-wpf-app.slnx     <- Open in Blend
├── MainWindow.xaml          <- Left navigation + right content viewer
├── migrated/                <- 27 converted UserControls
├── db/migration-db.json     <- Migration status DB (v2)
└── docs/animation-migration-guide.md  <- Core conversion guide

## Roadmap

This project will **continuously add sample web pages alongside harness design upgrades**.

- [ ] **Publisher App HTML Implementation** (Case W) — Implement publisher-app.pen design + 12 animation guides as an actual web page
- [ ] **WPF Template Expansion** (Case A) — Add CAT 10+ (Scroll-driven Animation, View Transition, etc.)
- [ ] **New Project Designs** (Case B) — Various app layouts: dashboards, e-commerce, SaaS landing pages, and more
- [ ] **Harness v3.0** — Auto-connect Case B->W pipeline, add accessibility evaluation axis
- [ ] **Design System** — Reusable component library shareable across projects

> All samples follow the **Animation-First Design** principle: look & feel and animation guides are designed first, then implemented.
